# Hausalang: Programming in Hausa

Hi! I just launched **Hausalang**, an open-source programming language designed specifically for Hausa-speaking beginners.

## Why This Matters

- **70M Hausa speakers** worldwide, but almost zero localized programming tools
- **Learning in your native language** is proven to improve comprehension
- **No setup friction** - code directly in the browser

## Features

✅ Variables and assignment
✅ String concatenation and arithmetic
✅ If/else and elif statements
✅ Functions with parameters and return
✅ Comments and expressions
✅ Bilingual error messages (Hausa + English)

## Try It Now

**[Open the Playground](https://hausalang-xyz.replit.dev)** - Click an example and run code instantly.

## Code Example

```hausa
aiki greet(name):
    mayar "Sannu " + name

rubuta greet("Nura")  # prints: Sannu Nura
```

## Open Source

Everything is on GitHub: https://github.com/mnura361234-ship-it/hausalang

**Questions?** Ask in the comments. I'm monitoring feedback closely to improve the language.

Would love to hear what you think!

## Dev.to Post (Technical Audience)

```markdown
# Building Hausalang: A Programming Language for Hausa Speakers

I just shipped the first version of Hausalang, an interpreted programming language designed for Hausa-speaking beginners.

Here's the journey:

## The Problem

70 million Hausa speakers exist worldwide. How many can learn programming in their native language?

**Answer: Zero.** Until now.

Research shows that learning in your native language significantly improves comprehension and retention. Yet, every programming language is in English. Hausalang fixes this.

## What I Built

A lightweight Python-based interpreter that:
- Executes Hausa-keyword programs line-by-line
- Supports variables, functions, conditionals, arithmetic, and strings
- Provides bilingual error messages (Hausa + English)
- Runs locally, on Termux (Android), and in the browser
- Works on any device with Python 3.8+

## Architecture

**Lexer** → **Parser** → **Interpreter**

No AST, no compilation. Just simple tokenization, shunting-yard for expressions, and line-by-line execution. Perfect for beginners.

## Try the Playground

No installation. Code directly in your browser:

**[Hausalang Playground](https://hausalang-xyz.replit.dev)**

## Open Source

All code is on GitHub with full documentation and examples:
https://github.com/mnura361234-ship-it/hausalang

## What's Next?

- Tutorials and lessons integrated into the playground
- Loop constructs (kaie)
- List/array support
- Community contributions
- Potential partnerships with schools

**Feedback wanted!** What should we build next?
```

Subject: 🎓 Hausalang - Learn Programming in Hausa (Live Now!)

Hi [Name],

I just launched something I'm really proud of: Hausalang.

It's the first programming language designed for Hausa speakers. No installation needed—you can code right now in your browser.

→ Try it: [YOUR_REPLIT_URL]

Why this matters:
- 70M Hausa speakers exist, but zero localized programming tools
- Learning in your native language helps you understand better
- It's totally free and open source

The playground has 5 built-in examples. Click one and press "Run Code" to see it work.

If you try it, I'd love to hear what you think. What's confusing? What should we add next?

Cheers,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know any teachers, students, or tech communities in Hausa-speaking regions, I'd appreciate a share!

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

Your launch is **Step 1** of a bigger journey:

1. **Playground** (now) → get users, gather feedback
2. **Tutorials** (month 2) → teach programming with lessons
3. **Community** (month 3) → users contribute examples, share code
4. **Schools** (month 6) → partner with educators
5. **Mobile App** (month 12) → iOS/Android native apps
6. **Revenue** (year 2) → premium courses, certifications

But you don't build all this alone. You build it **with users**, based on **real feedback**.
