## Red Flags (Watch For These)

🚨 If you see these, take action:

- [ ] No feedback for 2 weeks → Reshare, reach new audience
- [ ] Lots of "How do I...?" → Create tutorial for that
- [ ] Same bug reported twice → Fix ASAP
- [ ] Users abandoning → Something's broken, investigate
- [ ] Zero visitors → Reshare, maybe different audience needed

---

## Green Flags (Keep Doing These)

🟢 If you see these, you're winning:

- [ ] Users sharing with others
- [ ] People trying increasingly complex code
- [ ] Positive comments/feedback
- [ ] Feature requests (means people want more)
- [ ] Repeat visitors (coming back)
